# A Written Report for the School District Analysis
## PyCitySchools_challenge
1. Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to provide overall performance of the different types of schools as well the average of the math or reading scores by each schools. 
This will help city school district plan better to perform better in the future.  This will also find how budget related to each school performance.

2. Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
How is the district summary affected?
Per district summary, there are 15 schools and 39,170 students in summary.  Average math score is 78.9 and average reading score is 81.9, therefore students are doing better with reading.  
% of passing math is 74.8% and % passing reading is 86.8, therefore higher number of students are passing reading.

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Replacing 9th graders was affected on % passing reading that was decreased from 97.3% to 69.1% since all of 9th graders has high scores.  Replacing 9th graders was also affected  on % passing math  that was decreased from 93.3% to  66.9%.

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Average math score was slightly increased without 9th grader counted in since math scores in 9th graders were lower than other graders.  
Average reading score had no changes whether the 9th graders were counted in the calculation or not.   
Scores by school spending
Spending more per student decreased average math score and average reading score.  And spending more per student decreased passing rates of math, also spending lowest per person made passing reading rate the highest therefore the highest overall passing rate was in the lowest spending per person.

Scores by school type
per below analysis, charter schools are performing much better than district schools.   Charter school's overall passing rate 87% is much higher than district school's overall passing rate 54%.

3. Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
1) Thomas was not one of top 5 schools that are overall passing rate over 90%.  
2) Passing math rate was decreased from 93.2% to 66.9%.
3)Passing reading rate was decreased from 97.3%. to  69.7%. as well as overall passing rate. 
4) Overall charter school's performance was decreased due to Thomas High School's 9th graders replacement.
